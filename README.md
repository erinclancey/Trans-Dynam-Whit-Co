Public health policy at institutions of higher education was a pervasive challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second wave of COVID-19 in fall 2020, the re-opening of colleges and universities was controversial because incidence in young adults was on the rise. The migration of students back to institutional campuses worried many that transmission within student populations would spread into surrounding communities. However, many colleges and universities held stead fast to mitigation strategies and these efforts in many cases were successful, with many examples of limited spread into surrounding communities. Whitman County in Washington State is an example of a community, the city of Pullman, co-located with a large university, Washington State University (WSU), where the role of students returning to the area for the fall 2020 semester was contentious. Using COVID-19 incidence reported to Whitman County, we retrospectively study the transmission dynamics that occurred between the student and community subpopulations in fall 2020. Thus, we develop a two-population ordinary differential equation mechanistic model to infer transmission rates within and across the university student and community subpopulations. We use results from Bayesian analysis to determine if sustained transmission of COVID-19 occurred in Whitman County and the magnitude of cross-transmission from students to community members. We find these results are consistent with estimation of the time-varying reproductive number and conclude that the students returning to WSU-Pullman did not place the surrounding community in undue risk of COVID-19 during fall 2020.
